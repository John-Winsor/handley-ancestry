          <p>Ken Campbell was a successful comic actor and entertainer and is the only relative known to have attained national prominence.&nbsp;
          He specialised in the &quot;Theatre of the Absurd&quot;.&nbsp; Ken was the son of Elsie Campbell <i>n&eacute;e</i> Handley, daughter of
          Walter John Handley who was half-brother to my grandfather Arthur Handley.&nbsp; Hence Elsie Campbell was cousin to Dora and Daisy.</p>
          
          <p>Ken was born in 1941 so he was four years younger than me.&nbsp; His mother Elsie was born in 1905, one year before my own mother Daisy.&nbsp;
          It appears that the family lived in Barkingside, Ilford where I attended secondary school, about two miles from our home.&nbsp;
          It seems strange that his family and my own never contacted each-other over all those years.</p>
          
          <p>During the 1970s my mother decided that she would like to meet Ken.&nbsp; She found the address of his agent at Bromley library,
          then wrote to him via the agent.&nbsp; Ken replied with a nice personal letter.&nbsp; At that time he was living in Stoke Newington,
          north London.&nbsp; But they never did meet.&nbsp; My mother lived in hope that he might appear at the local theatre, but that never
          happened.</p>
          
          <p>Sadly, Ken died suddenly in August 2008 aged 66.&nbsp; He is survived by his ex-wife, the actress Prunella Gee, and daughter Daisy.</p>
