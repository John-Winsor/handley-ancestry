      <font color="#000000" size="4">Having left
Ilford in 1958 a visit there today is an astounding experience,
something like a trip in a time machine.&nbsp; I fantasise that
some Pied Piper had walked through the streets, and all the English
came streaming out of their houses and followed him over the
horizon.&nbsp; And when the town was empty and deserted, vast
hoards of Asians from the sub-continent came pouring in.&nbsp; They
occupied the abandoned homes, schools and offices.&nbsp; They slept
in the English beds and took over the English lives.&nbsp; A walk
down Ilford High Road today is like a trip to Mumbai.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">I want to say,
though, that the Asians have done better than the English ever did.&nbsp;
They installed double glazing and central heating.&nbsp; They ripped-out
front gardens and paved them over to accommodate their enormous people
carriers.&nbsp; They have lots of money and they are busy spending it.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">
Interestingly, examination of Google satellite images reveals that,
in many cases, individual homeowners have had a cottage constructed
at the far end of their back gardens.&nbsp; The purpose, no doubt,
was to provide independent accommodation for their ageing parents,
something unknown to the original ethnic English owners.&nbsp;
Though I would say that, in my time, most of the original owners
would have lacked the financial resources to do this.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">The streets
where I grew up are quiet, the homes neat and well kept.&nbsp;
There is, of course, the occasional Islamic Learning Centre
(a mosque by any other name...), and the occasional outrageous
Romanesque plaster portico.&nbsp; How could the Council give
approval for <i>that</i>?&nbsp; Well, actually, the Council
are all Indian too.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">
In the High Road nothing remains of the building that was once the
Handley fish shop.&nbsp; It was demolished and rebuilt long ago.&nbsp;
But many other shops retain their original Victorian brickwork and windows,
still evident above the glass-and-chrome shopfronts.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4"> Occasionally I see
an ethnic English person walking along.&nbsp; I feel like calling out:&nbsp;
"Hey, we're both English!&nbsp; Isn't that something!"&nbsp; I have lunch
in a caf&eacute;.&nbsp; The staff are friendly and condescend to speak
English.&nbsp; But they look at me with curious eyes.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4"> Ilford today is
multi-cultural only to the extent that it comprises Hindus, Muslims
and Sikhs.&nbsp; Anglo-Saxons are not part of the mix.&nbsp;
As did the Saxons once banish the Celts, so in turn have they been
displaced by cultures better adapted to survive.&nbsp; The question
is how to talk about these matters without risking the accusation of
xenophobia?</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">
But it might be said that the the ethnic English had only themselves to
blame.&nbsp; Faced with the government's policy of encouraging mass
immigration without adequate planning, nobody forced the English to sell-up
and move away.&nbsp; Evidently they regarded themselves as entirely
incompatible with the newcomers and their Indian culture.&nbsp; Might the
Ilford English have been victims of their own prejudice?

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4"> Another pilgrimage
to Ilford, and I have lunch in Bodgers' cafeteria.&nbsp; Bodgers must be
among the last of the traditional English department stores, dating from
1921.&nbsp; Gangan would have known it well.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4"> I find the cafeteria
clientele exclusively to comprise elderly English ladies taking tea.&nbsp;
This is their little oasis.&nbsp; I would expect to find the same kind of
people in the tearoom of Raffles Hotel in Singapore, assuming that Raffles
now caters for elderly ex-patriots.&nbsp; It is as though there were an
invisible notice that said:&nbsp; "Whites only".</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4"> Have Bodgers and
Raffles come to symbolize the last vestiges of a now defunct English
presence?&nbsp; Has Ilford come to resemble an ex-British colony,
now returned to its "rightful" owners?</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4"> Still seeking the
Holy Grail of a continuing ethnic English residency in the borough.&nbsp;
Surely it must be there somewhere, perhaps clinging onto existence in the
posh and leafy outskirts?</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4"> Not that anywhere in
Ilford can truly be described as "posh".&nbsp; The newest and best district,
constructed in the late 1930s, is to be found in Barkingside which is
pressed hard against the green belt.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4"> So I take the bus to
Barkingside to find my old school.&nbsp; It looks surprisingly the same as
it did sixty years ago.&nbsp; How I would love to be ushered inside.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4"> But an inspection of the
school's external noticeboard reveals that the revolution has been complete.&nbsp;
The names both of staff and of prominent students say everything.&nbsp;
Do my feelings of regret betray a dormant racism?&nbsp; I don't think so.&nbsp;
It's just a sentimental regard for times past.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4"> When did the Ilford English
ever vote for political policies that would change the race, culture and religion
of their world?&nbsp; When did they ever ask to be transformed into strangers in
their own town, and feel obliged to move away?</font></p>
