<i>In making this presentation I have often felt that my ancestors and
their family members are not really dead.&nbsp; Rather are they still
alive and continue living in the past.&nbsp; A paradoxical illusion
hardly unique to myself.&nbsp; It is as though the dead still retain a
link to the living through heirlooms, letters, photographs and anecdotes.&nbsp;
To break the link is to consign them forever to oblivion, to non-existence
until the end of time.</i></font>

            <p><font size="4">
<i>In considering the circumstances following Arthur Handley's estrangement
it seems that a deliberate attempt was made to break that link.&nbsp;
The evident motive was retribution that reached even into the next world.&nbsp;
Although hardly an admirable sentiment I suppose this is part of the human
experience and has to be accepted.</i></font></p>

      <p align="left"> <font size="4">
In about 1922 the Handley family experienced a traumatic event that
was to re-shape their lives.&nbsp; It suddenly became revealed that
Arthur Handley had formed a relationship with the young woman cashier
who was his employee at the fish shop.&nbsp; It seems that Arthur had
no alternative intentions for his future life and that his new
relationship was entirely opportunistic.&nbsp; I imagine that all Hell
broke loose.&nbsp; Arthur and the Cashier fled to start a new life
elsewhere.&nbsp; The fish shop was sold and Mary and Daisy moved to
72 De Vere Gardens, Ilford.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">
Dora was not present having married in 1921.&nbsp; The photo of Arthur
and Mary, displayed to the right, was taken at Dora and Stanley's wedding
when Arthur was aged 50.</font></p>

      <center>
      <p align="left"><font size="4">
It appears that, in consequence, the acrimony towards Arthur was immense
indeed.&nbsp; His desertion was perceived as treachery, and it looks as
though there was a family conspiracy to "airbrush" him out of history.&nbsp;
In terms of the "newspeak" of Orwell's <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>,
Arthur became an "unperson".<i>&nbsp; </i>During my childhood my mother
almost never mentioned her father.&nbsp; She would simply say that he was
dead, and seemed to speak with satisfaction.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">
To be as objective as I can I would say that this was a successful
marriage.&nbsp; It lasted nearly 30 years and raised three children
to adulthood.&nbsp; Arthur was a hardworking and enterprising man
who successfully ran his own business and supported his family.&nbsp; As
people grow older they change, of course, not usually for the better.</font></p>

      </center>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">Arthur's
relationship with the Cashier was evidently short-lived.&nbsp; She
is not mentioned in his Will made in 1925.&nbsp; He</font><font size="4">
bequeaths all his worldly possessions to his wife Mary Ann Handley.&nbsp;
But there are some curious aspects to the Will and these are discussed on
the next page.</font> </p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>Arthur
Handley's death</u>:<br>

Arthur died on the 30th April 1934 at his home in Leytonstone at the
age of 63 years.&nbsp; The death was registered <b> on the
same day</b> by a person who appears to be an agent of the
undertaker.&nbsp; The Death Certificate (shown bottom of page)
states the cause of death as "carcinoma of the pancreas".</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">
It seems that Arthur's death was a "moment of truth" for the rest of
the family.&nbsp; Having passed the previous twelve years ostracizing
him they found themselves confronted with a new and unwelcome
situation.&nbsp; They would have to dispose of his body because no-one
else was going to do it.</font></p>

      <center>
      <p align="left"><font size="4"><span lang="EN-GB">It looks as
though Arthur's demise was anticipated.&nbsp; Somebody decided to act
with great haste.&nbsp; The undertaker was waiting like a vulture.</span>

      <p align="left"><font size="4"><u>Arthur
Handley's last rites</u>:<br>

In response to my letter of inquiry I received information from the
City of London Cemetery, which is very close to Ilford, to the effect
that Arthur Handley's body was cremated there on the 3rd May,
1934.&nbsp; The significance of the date is that it is <b>
only three days</b> after his death.&nbsp; It looks as though
my grandmother and her daughters organised the funeral with great haste
in order to render impossible any participation by Arthur's surviving half-
brothers and sisters who, perhaps, had supported him in the family
rift.&nbsp I imagine that they were extremely angry.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">So I
presume that Arthur had just five "mourners" all of whom hated
him.&nbsp; Or perhaps they boycotted the funeral despite having
arranged it.&nbsp; But I would prefer to believe that there was
another, less ugly reality.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">At this
distance in time it is hard enough to adduce even the simplest of
facts, and I have felt compelled to apply constructions based upon
scant evidence.&nbsp; The main fact, here, is that I don't know what
really happened.&nbsp; I would invite the reader to finish the story,
if possible, in whatever way he/she might choose.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">As I
have said, the subject of my grandfather was never discussed with
me.&nbsp; But when I was aged 15, Gangan unexpectedly presented me
with a small snuffbox containing a little photograph, displayed to the
right.&nbsp; For some reason she had trimmed it with nail scissors,
thereby depriving it of the context of the fish shop in the
background.&nbsp; She wanted me to have this photo of her husband,
and this might suggest that she did not entirely agree with the family
policy of removing Arthur from history.</font></p>
