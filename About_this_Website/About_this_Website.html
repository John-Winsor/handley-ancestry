          <p>This website grew out of my wish to create a "100 year time capsule" and historical resource for the interest and benefit
          of present and future descendants of my maternal grandparents Arthur and Mary Handley.&nbsp; It represents the culmination of
          my plan to commemorate the Handley family.</p>
          
          <p>My retirement in 2002 enabled me to concentrate on the task of distributing the small number of family heirlooms, memorabilia
          and, especially, photographs that had passed into my possession from my mother.&nbsp; I regarded that project as something necessary
          and important.</p>
          
          <p>Of greatest significance, I think, are the photographic images and those letters that have survived.&nbsp; In this website I have
          added such stories and anecdotes that I can remember.&nbsp; There is not much here from my personal experience and I regret the
          limitation of my own contribution.&nbsp; However, I can still remember some of the stories recounted by my mother and grandmother
          and I have endeavoured to reproduce these on the website.</p>
          
          <p>Additionally I am presenting some selected public documents which have their own stories to tell.&nbsp; I refer here to various census
          returns and to certificates of birth, marriage and death.&nbsp; The earliest of these is Arthur Curle's Birth Certificate dated 1870.&nbsp;
          There is also Arthur's Will dated 1925.&nbsp; Where it seemed necessary I have added my personal interpretations of the bare facts which
          these documents reveal.&nbsp; I hope I have succeeded in avoiding the error of undue subjectivity.</p>
          
          <p>It would have been a great idea had our ancestors Thomas &amp; Harriet Curle, Sarah Ann Handley <b><i>n&eacute;e</i></b> Curle and
          Arthur &amp; Mary Handley decided to leave us a few messages hidden, perhaps, underneath a rock.&nbsp; What might they have said to us?&nbsp;
          How about:<p>
        </div>
        <div class="center">
          <p><b>"Do good if you can, but at least do no harm.&nbsp; And remember that without us you would not exist".</b></p>

          <p>Today the technology of the twenty-first century has empowered us to communicate more easily with succeeding generations by
          leaving a cache of digital data for them to find.&nbsp; It is no small undertaking to store data electronically for 100 years.&nbsp;
          Other than inscriptions on stone made by ancient civilizations, the most durable media to the present time has proved to be paper.&nbsp;
          This may yet be shown to exceed in durability any means provided by present or future technology.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p><u>Technical notes concerning display of this website</u>:</p>
          
          <p>The fundamental problem in creating web pages (in 2009) is the multiplicity of standards for their display.&nbsp;
          This has always been the case with the Internet, but as time passes the problem is actually getting worse!&nbsp;
          This problem is caused by differences between the two basic types of personal computer available ("IBM clone" versus Apple Macintosh),
          differences between the various Web Browsers that abound, (differences even between consecutive versions of the <i>same</i> Web Browser),
          and finally, the large number of different monitor screen resolutions.&nbsp; The latter is now exacerbated by the demand for the widescreen
          display of films, something for which the Internet was never conceived.</p>
          
          <p>This website was originally created for display with Microsoft Internet Explorer version 7 and using an LCD monitor of resolution
          1024 x 768 pixels.&nbsp; When Internet Explorer was upgraded to version 8 the effect on the presentation of the website was to degrade it.&nbsp;
          In particular, horizontal scroll-bars appeared, something that I regard as wholely unacceptable.&nbsp; Consequently the website was modified
          such as to provide a reasonable display with my original monitor resolution.&nbsp; Recently, however, my LCD monitor was upgraded and the new
          one has a resolution of 1280 x 1024 pixels.&nbsp; Again, adjustments were necessary for the optimum display of the website.</p>
          
          <p>I have to conclude that it is futile to chase these problems which, with the passage of time, present a moving target.&nbsp; Who could
          guess the display standards that might exist one hundred years hence?</p>
