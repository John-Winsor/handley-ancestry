      <font size="4">This website grew out of my wish to
create a "100 year time capsule" and historical resource for the interest and benefit of present and future descendants of my maternal grandparents
Arthur and Mary Handley.&nbsp; It represents the culmination of my
plan to commemorate the Handley family.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">
My retirement in 2002 enabled me to concentrate on the task of
distributing the small number of family heirlooms, memorabilia and,
especially, photographs that had passed into my possession from my
mother.&nbsp; I regarded that project as something necessary and
important.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">
Of greatest significance, I think, are the photographic images and
those letters that have survived.&nbsp; In this website I have added
such stories and anecdotes that I can remember.&nbsp; There is not
much here from my personal experience and I regret the limitation of
my own contribution.&nbsp; However, I can still remember some of the
stories recounted by my mother and grandmother and I have endeavoured
to reproduce these on the website.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">
Additionally I am presenting some selected public documents which
have their own stories to tell.&nbsp; I refer here to various census
returns and to certificates of birth, marriage and death.&nbsp;
The earliest of these is Arthur Curle's Birth Certificate dated 1870.&nbsp;
There is also Arthur's Will dated 1925.&nbsp; Where it seemed necessary
I have added my personal interpretations of the bare facts which these
documents reveal.&nbsp; I hope I have succeeded in avoiding the error
of undue subjectivity.</font></p>

      <p align="left"> <font size="4">
It would have been a great idea had our ancestors Thomas &amp;
Harriet Curle, Sarah Ann Handley <i> <b> n&eacute;e</b></i>
Curle and Arthur &amp; Mary Handley decided to leave us a few
messages hidden, perhaps, underneath a rock.&nbsp; What might
they have said to us?&nbsp; How about: </font><br>

      <font size="3">
<b>"Do good if you can, but at least do no harm.&nbsp;
And remember that without us you would not exist".</b></font></p>

      <p align="left"> <font size="4">
Today the technology of the twenty-first century has empowered us to
communicate more easily with succeeding generations by leaving a cache
of digital data for them to find.&nbsp; It is no small undertaking to
store data electronically for 100 years.&nbsp;
Other than inscriptions on stone made by ancient civilizations, the
most durable media to the present time has proved to be paper.&nbsp;
This may yet be shown to exceed in durability any means provided by
present or future technology.</font></p>

      Technical notes concerning display of this website</u>:</font>
      </p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">
The fundamental problem in creating web pages (in 2009) is the multiplicity of standards for their display.&nbsp; This has always
been the case with the Internet, but as time passes the problem
is actually getting worse!&nbsp; This problem is caused by differences
between the two basic types of personal computer available ("IBM clone"
versus Apple Macintosh), differences between the various Web Browsers that abound, (differences even between consecutive versions of the
<i>same</i> Web Browser), and finally, the large number of different
monitor screen resolutions.&nbsp; The latter is now exacerbated by the
demand for the widescreen display of films, something for which the
Internet was never conceived.</font> </p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">
This website was originally created for display with Microsoft Internet
Explorer version 7 and using an LCD monitor of resolution 1024 x 768
pixels.&nbsp; When Internet Explorer was upgraded to version 8 the
effect on the presentation of the website was to degrade it.&nbsp;
In particular, horizontal scroll-bars appeared, something that I regard
as wholely unacceptable.&nbsp; Consequently the website was modified
such as to provide a reasonable display with my original monitor
resolution.&nbsp; Recently, however, my LCD monitor was upgraded and
the new one has a resolution of 1280 x 1024 pixels.&nbsp; Again,
adjustments were necessary for the optimum display of the website.</font> </p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">
I have to conclude that it is futile to chase these problems which, with
the passage of time, present a moving target.&nbsp; Who could guess the
display standards that might exist one hundred years hence?</font></p>
