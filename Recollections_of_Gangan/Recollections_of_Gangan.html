promulgate herewith a few more rambling notes concerning the Handley
family, this </font>time about Gangan in particular.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">On the day I was born Gangan would have been in her
late sixties, and my earliest memories of her are of an elderly
person.&nbsp; A child's view of the world is without the
perspective of time, of course, so it had seemed to me that Gangan must
always have been elderly.&nbsp; It was as though she had been born
elderly.&nbsp; So I was very impressed when, within the last twenty
years, I discovered the photograph which showed Gangan as I had never
seen her before, a woman aged about forty together with her young
family.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">This brilliant photograph of the Handley family
taken in 1910, which now graces the front page of this Website, was
never shown to me.&nbsp; My mother kept it wrapped in brown paper,
tied with string and placed at the back of a cupboard.&nbsp; This
was, no doubt, because the picture featured my mother's
father.&nbsp; But, even so, my mother evidently could not bear to
throw it away.&nbsp; I discovered the picture after my parents
moved to Bromley, and tore open the brown paper enough to reveal the
photo.&nbsp; But I never mentioned this to my mother because I
sensed that some kind of taboo applied here.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">My memories of Gangan are of a kindly and concerned
person who loved her children and grandchildren.&nbsp; When she
stayed at our house she seemed forever sewing buttons and darning
socks.&nbsp; She was very pious and would attend church every
Sunday without fail.&nbsp; Her faith was simple and
strong.&nbsp; Intellectual she was not.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">I remember that Gangan had an idiosyncratic
aversion to the police.&nbsp; She would come out with sayings like:
"Set a thief to catch a thief."&nbsp; My mother would blame Uncle
Will (<i>see ahead</i>), the suggestion being that Gangan
had been "brainwashed" by him.&nbsp; While it may be true that
Uncle Will was somewhere to the left of Lenin, I doubted his power to
brainwash anyone.&nbsp; Hence the origin of Gangan's prejudice remains a mystery.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">In consequence, perhaps, of Gangan's family origins
in East London she spoke with a dialect slightly different to my own.&nbsp;
Today the only differences that come to mind are her use of the term "a twelvemonth"
(meaning a year) and her use of the verb "to hark" (meaning to listen).</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">In later life Gangan became profoundly deaf in both
ears.&nbsp; There was a family myth that this was the consequence
of a severe bout of 'flu'.&nbsp; I have no doubt that the cause was
a genetic predisposition linked to the physical deterioration of old
age.&nbsp; My mother suffered deafness in an identical way
(although I believe Dora was largely unaffected).&nbsp; Gangan
would wear a hearing-aid of early design containing "valves" (evacuated
electronic glass tubes).&nbsp; This required heavy batteries which
she carried in a home-made "kangaroo" style pouch under her skirt.<img src="72_De_Vere_Gardens.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="300" width="220"></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">Gangan lived alone at 72 De Vere Gardens about a
mile from our home in Ilford.&nbsp; The photo is displayed to the
right.&nbsp; This was a typical mid-terrace Victorian house with
sash bay windows and a small back garden.&nbsp; But one day (in the
late 1940's) I was told that she had moved to Preston Park, Brighton to
live in the home of Uncle "Will" Watson and his daughter Cissie
Watson.&nbsp; Uncle Will was a little older than Gangan and was
related to her by marriage to his late wife Aunt Alice (Gangan's sister).&nbsp; Later, Gangan moved again to live in a
rented bed-sit near to Preston Park.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">So it appears, from this distance in time, that the
house in De Vere Gardens had become too much to manage.&nbsp; That
is understandable for a person aged around 80.&nbsp; It seems
likely that Gangan's welfare had become a matter of desperation to her
daughters and their spouses.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">In today's circumstances the problem might have
been resolved by the purchase of a ground-floor flat in
Ilford.&nbsp; But the social climate of that time was very
different.&nbsp; The national economy was still shattered by the
war and accommodation in London would have been difficult to obtain due
to mass demobilisation of the armed forces.&nbsp; The Welfare State
was born only in 1948, hence there was no social housing.&nbsp;
Very few flats were purpose-built pre-war.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">Having said this, I am inclined to think that
Gangan's time in Brighton was probably a mistake.</font></p>
