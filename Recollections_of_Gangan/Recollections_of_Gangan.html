        <p><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size:25px;color:#ff0000;"><b><i>A</i></b></span>s is my wont, from time-to-time, I promulgate herewith a few more rambling notes
        concerning the Handley family, this time about Gangan in particular.</p>
        
        <p>On the day I was born Gangan would have been in her late sixties, and my earliest memories of her are of an elderly person.&nbsp; 
        A child's view of the world is without the perspective of time, of course, so it had seemed to me that Gangan must always have been
        elderly.&nbsp; It was as though she had been born elderly.&nbsp; So I was very impressed when, within the last twenty years, I discovered
        the photograph which showed Gangan as I had never seen her before, a woman aged about forty together with her young family.</p>
        
        <p>This brilliant photograph of the Handley family taken in 1910, that now graces the front page of this Website, was never shown to me.&nbsp;
        My mother kept it wrapped in brown paper, tied with string and placed at the back of a cupboard.&nbsp; This was, no doubt, because the picture
        featured my mother's father.&nbsp; But, even so, my mother evidently could not bear to throw it away.&nbsp; I discovered the picture after my
        parents moved to Bromley, and tore open the brown paper enough to reveal the photo.&nbsp; But I never mentioned this to my mother because I
        sensed that some kind of taboo applied here.</p>
        
        <p>My memories of Gangan are of a kindly and concerned person who loved her children and grandchildren.&nbsp; When she stayed at our house
        she seemed forever sewing buttons and darning socks.&nbsp; She was very pious and would attend church every Sunday without fail.&nbsp;
        Her faith was simple and strong.&nbsp; Intellectual she was not.</p>
        
        <p>I remember that Gangan had an idiosyncratic aversion to the police.&nbsp; She would come out with sayings like: "Set a thief to catch
        a thief."&nbsp; My mother would blame Uncle Will (<i>see ahead</i>), the suggestion being that Gangan had been "brainwashed" by him.&nbsp;
        While it may be true that Uncle Will was somewhere to the left of Lenin, I doubted his power to brainwash anyone.&nbsp; Hence the origin
        of Gangan's prejudice remains a mystery.</p>
        
        <p>In consequence, perhaps, of Gangan's family origins in East London she spoke with a dialect slightly different to my own.&nbsp;
        Today the only differences that come to mind are her use of the term "a twelvemonth" (meaning a year) and her use of the verb "to hark"
        (meaning to listen).</p>
        
        <p>In later life Gangan became profoundly deaf in both ears.&nbsp; There was a family myth that this was the consequence of a severe
        bout of 'flu'.&nbsp; I have no doubt that the cause was a genetic predisposition linked to the physical deterioration of old age.&nbsp;
        My mother suffered deafness in an identical way (although I believe Dora was largely unaffected).&nbsp; Gangan would wear a hearing-aid of
        early design containing "valves" (evacuated electronic glass tubes).&nbsp; This required heavy batteries which she carried in a home-made
        "kangaroo" style pouch under her skirt.</p>
        
        <img src="72_De_Vere_Gardens.jpg" alt="" height="300" width="220">
        
        <p>Gangan lived alone at 72 De Vere Gardens about a mile from our home in Ilford.&nbsp; The photo is displayed to the right.&nbsp;
        This was a typical mid-terrace Victorian house with sash bay windows and a small back garden.&nbsp; But one day (in the late 1940's)
        I was told that she had moved to Preston Park, Brighton to live in the home of Uncle "Will" Watson and his daughter Cissie Watson.&nbsp; 
        Uncle Will was a little older than Gangan and was related to her by marriage to his late wife Aunt Alice (Gangan's sister).&nbsp;
        Later, Gangan moved again to live in a rented bed-sit near to Preston Park.</p>
        
        <p>So it appears, from this distance in time, that the house in De Vere Gardens had become too much to manage.&nbsp;
        That is understandable for a person aged around 80.&nbsp; It seems likely that Gangan's welfare had become a matter of desperation to
        her daughters and their spouses.</p>
        
        <p>In today's circumstances the problem might have been resolved by the purchase of a ground-floor flat in Ilford.&nbsp;
        But the social climate of that time was very different.&nbsp; The national economy was still shattered by the war and accommodation in
        London would have been difficult to obtain due to mass demobilisation of the armed forces.&nbsp;
        The Welfare State was born only in 1948, hence there was no social housing.&nbsp; Very few flats were purpose-built pre-war.</p>
        
        <p>Having said this, I am inclined to think that Gangan's time in Brighton was probably a mistake.</p>
