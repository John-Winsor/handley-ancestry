          <p>Dear Mr. & Mrs. Handley,</p>
          
          <p>I have here to perform the painful duty of informing you of your son Arthur's death.&nbsp; He was killed on the 16th day of August
          in the Ypres sector.&nbsp; I must admit that I have been a very considerable time informing you, but as he was transferred to another
          Company before hand, I had to make the necessary enquiries, and from all accounts he died bravely while performing his duties for his
          King & Country.</p>

          <p>Dear Mr. & Mrs. Handley,</p>
          
          <p>I am writing you at the request of Dora, who expressed her wish in a letter dated 7 / 9 / 17 that I should convey full particulars
          as regards your son Arthur's death.</p>
          
          <p>I have done my utmost to gain all information possible, and have found that poor Arthur was buried by a shell with another Sgt.&nbsp;
          It occurred two hundred yards east of <b>(censored)</b> west of <b>(censored)</b>.</p>
          
          <p>They were dug out by some of their comrades who were close at hand, but<br>

          Mr. Handley in your bereavement.</p>
