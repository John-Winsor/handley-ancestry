          <p>Arthur Thomas Handley was born in June 1895 in West Ham, East London.&nbsp; Subsequently the family moved to Ilford, Essex where
          his father Arthur Handley opened a fish and poultry shop at<br>72 - 74 High Road, Ilford.&nbsp; The family lived above the shop.&nbsp;
          At the time the Great War broke out in 1914 Arthur Thomas was indentured as an apprentice to an engineering company in East London.</p>

          <p>I was told by my grandmother that Arthur had been deeply upset because he was given a "white feather" by some young women at work.&nbsp;
          I believe this symbolic act of cruelty was not uncommon in the social climate of the time.&nbsp; Whether or not that was the motive, Arthur
          resolved to join the army.&nbsp; But he was bound by his Articles of Apprenticeship to remain at work.&nbsp; So in March 1915, aged nearly
          20, he decided the issue by running away and signing-up with the army.</p>

          <p>On the next page is displayed Arthur's first letter home.&nbsp; He is obviously concerned about the political repercussions of his actions.</p>

          <p>There was a story that Arthur was first sent to a training camp in north Essex after which he was put on a train to Portsmouth for
          embarkation.&nbsp; When the train was approaching Ilford station Arthur wrote his father a hasty note and tied it to a penknife.&nbsp;
          As the train shot through the station he threw it out of the window.&nbsp; The penknife with note attached was retrieved from the platform and
          delivered to his family.&nbsp; In consequence his parents journeyed to Portsmouth and were briefly re-united with Arthur before he embarked.</p>

          <p>Arthur served with the Royal Fusiliers on the Western Front in France and Belgium.&nbsp; In July 1916 he survived the Battle of the
          Somme along with only 11 others from his Company after being ordered to go "over the top".&nbsp; It is a matter of sad record that Arthur
          was killed in August 1917 by a German shell.&nbsp; This happened due to sporadic shelling and was not part of any specific battle.&nbsp;
          He was then aged 22 years.&nbsp; It is surprising, perhaps, that he survived as long as he did.</p>

          <p>Arthur's grave is in Hooge Crater Military Cemetery, Belgium.&nbsp; This is on route N8 about 2&frac12; miles east of Ypres town centre.&nbsp;
          For those who would visit, Arthur's grave is first in row 6H.</p>

          <p>In consequence of the Great War there was terrible grief throughout the land.&nbsp; This encouraged the cult of spiritualism as distraught
          parents sought to contact their dead sons.&nbsp; In this sad climate my grandmother attended a spiritualist meeting where she heard words
          spoken that caused her fear and distress.&nbsp; She walked out of the meeting and never returned.&nbsp; I think the Handley family were
          broken by Arthur's death and I am not sure they ever fully recovered.</p>
