          <p>Dear Mrs. Handley,</p>
          
          <img src="./Arthurs_grave_1.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="308">
          
          <p>I have been asked to write you, by my chum Pte Cann, for he said you would like to know about your son Arthur.&nbsp;
          Well I shall be pleased to give you all I know, for me and your son were chums, and I was with him just before his death,
          for we were sitting in the trench together quite happy, for I was asking him how he came to get into B. Company, for we
          were both in A. Company together last year, and I got put into B. Company when I went back this year, and he was telling
          me that he was going to take charge of the platoon for the attack only, and of course we were talking about old times
          together, and about ten minutes afterwards, he and another Sgt named Scarce got buried by a shell, and Arthur got his neck
          broken and the other Sgt was badly wounded, but I can assure you that he bore no pain, and I was very much upset by his
          death, for we got on so well together, for we were on the Somme together, for he was on the same gun as me and Cann, and he
          had the misfortune to get wounded, but before he left the trench he shook hands with us, and I am sure we will miss him very
          very much, for he was so brave and fearless, and I know he was well liked by the Company, and will be missed by all.&nbsp;
          I shall be on leave shortly and shall only be too pleased to pay you a call.&nbsp; Hoping this letter will help you a bit,
          I also send my deepest sympathy for your great loss.</p>
          
          <p>From Yours Sincerely<p>
