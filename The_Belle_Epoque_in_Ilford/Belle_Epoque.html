                  <td width="100%"> <font size="4">Arthur
became the proprietor of a fish and poultry shop at <nobr>72 - 74</nobr>
High Road, Ilford then in Essex.&nbsp; The family lived above the
shop.&nbsp; I have an impression of his considerable commercial
success and consequent prosperity.&nbsp; It is obvious he had
learned the basics of the business from his step-father Walter John who
had owned a similar business in West Ham.</font>
                  <p align="left"><font size="4">Arthur
became a Freemason.&nbsp; My grandmother used to tell me how Arthur
would hold occasional Masonic meetings in their home.&nbsp; She
said that she could sometimes hear chanting and rhythmic
handclapping.&nbsp; That, of course, was the limit of her knowledge
of the subject.&nbsp; My mother used to have a jewel box containing
Arthur's Masonic "jewels".&nbsp; These were ingenious trinkets
bearing mystic symbols.&nbsp; I concluded that they were awarded in
recognition of Arthur's generous contributions to Masonic
charities.&nbsp; Freemasonry appears to function at different
levels and seems, here, to have served as an alternative "Chamber of
Commerce".&nbsp; It seems likely that Arthur's membership was an
investment that would provide him with support at a future time of
crisis as described in my article about the estrangement of his
marriage and the collapse of his business in about 1922.</font></p>

1906 was born Daisy Victoria who became my mother.&nbsp; Dora and
Daisy attended a Roman Catholic school in Ilford called "The Convent",
although the family were never Catholic.</font></p>

Thomas attended Ilford County High School, as did I.&nbsp; Except
that in my time the school had relocated to Barkingside, two miles
away.&nbsp; On the War Memorial in the vestibule was inscribed
among other names:&nbsp; "A. T. Handley".</font></p>
