          <p><i>The "Belle &Eacute;poque" in Europe is usually defined as that period between the beginning of
          the twentieth century and the start of the Great War.&nbsp; It was seen in retrospect as a "Golden Age",
          a time of universal prosperity and happiness.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although likely to be an exaggeration,
          this was surely the true "Belle &Eacute;poque" for my grandparents and their children.</i></p>

          <p>Arthur became the proprietor of a fish and poultry shop at 72 - 74 High Road, Ilford then in
          Essex.&nbsp; The family lived above the shop.&nbsp; I have an impression of his considerable
          commercial success and consequent prosperity.&nbsp; It is obvious he had learned the basics of
          the business from his step-father Walter John who had owned a similar business in West Ham.</p>
          
          <p>Arthur became a Freemason.&nbsp; My grandmother used to tell me how Arthur would hold occasional
          Masonic meetings in their home.&nbsp; She said that she could sometimes hear chanting and rhythmic
          handclapping.&nbsp; That, of course, was the limit of her knowledge of the subject.&nbsp; My mother
          used to have a jewel box containing Arthur's Masonic "jewels".&nbsp; These were ingenious trinkets
          bearing mystic symbols.&nbsp; I concluded that they were awarded in recognition of Arthur's generous
          contributions to Masonic charities.&nbsp; Freemasonry appears to function at different levels and seems,
          here, to have served as an alternative "Chamber of Commerce".&nbsp; It seems likely that Arthur's
          membership was an investment that would provide him with support at a future time of crisis as described
          in my article about the estrangement of his marriage and the collapse of his business in about 1922.</p>
          
          <p>In 1906 was born Daisy Victoria who became my mother.&nbsp; Dora and Daisy attended a Roman Catholic
          school in Ilford called "The Convent", although the family were never Catholic.</p>
          
          <p>Arthur Thomas attended Ilford County High School, as did I.&nbsp; Except that in my time the school
          had relocated to Barkingside, two miles away.&nbsp; On the War Memorial in the vestibule was inscribed
          among other names:&nbsp; "A. T. Handley".</p>
