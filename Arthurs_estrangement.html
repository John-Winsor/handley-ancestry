          <p><i>In making this presentation I have often felt that my ancestors and their family members are not really dead.&nbsp;
          Rather are they still alive and continue living in the past.&nbsp; A paradoxical illusion hardly unique to myself.&nbsp;
          It is as though the dead still retain a link to the living through heirlooms, letters, photographs and anecdotes.&nbsp;
          To break the link is to consign them forever to oblivion, to non-existence until the end of time.</i></p>

          <p><i>In considering the circumstances following Arthur Handley's estrangement it seems that a deliberate attempt
          was made to break that link.&nbsp; The evident motive was retribution that reached even into the next world.&nbsp;
          Although hardly an admirable sentiment I suppose this is part of the human experience and has to be accepted.</i></p>

          <p><i>I can do little more than to present the bare facts to the extent that I can understand them.&nbsp; Perhaps my
          account might serve to propitiate, in some way, for the sad and bad things that occurred. </i></p>

        <div class="left">
          <p>In about 1922 the Handley family experienced a traumatic event that was to re-shape their lives.&nbsp; It suddenly became
          revealed that Arthur Handley had formed a relationship with the young woman cashier who was his employee at the fish shop.&nbsp;
          It seems that Arthur had no alternative intentions for his future life and that his new relationship was entirely opportunistic.&nbsp;
          I imagine that all Hell broke loose.&nbsp; Arthur and the Cashier fled to start a new life elsewhere.&nbsp; The fish shop was sold
          and Mary and Daisy moved to 72 De Vere Gardens, Ilford.</p>

          <p> Dora was not present having married in 1921.&nbsp; The photo of Arthur and Mary, displayed to the right, was taken at Dora and
          Stanley's wedding when Arthur was aged 50.</p>

          <p>It appears that, in consequence, the acrimony towards Arthur was immense indeed.&nbsp; His desertion was perceived as treachery,
          and it looks as though there was a family conspiracy to "airbrush" him out of history.&nbsp; In terms of the "newspeak" of Orwell's
          <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>, Arthur became an "unperson".&nbsp; During my childhood my mother almost never mentioned her father.&nbsp;
          She would simply say that he was dead, and seemed to speak with satisfaction.</p>

          <p>To be as objective as I can I would say that this was a successful marriage.&nbsp; It lasted nearly 30 years and raised three
          children to adulthood.&nbsp; Arthur was a hardworking and enterprising man who successfully ran his own business and supported his
          family.&nbsp; As people grow older they change, of course, not usually for the better.</p>

          <p>Arthur's relationship with the Cashier was evidently short-lived.&nbsp; She is not mentioned in his Will made in 1925.&nbsp;
          He bequeaths all his worldly possessions to his wife Mary Ann Handley.&nbsp; But there are some curious aspects to the Will and
          these are discussed on the next page.</p>

          <p><u>Arthur Handley's death</u>:<br>

          Arthur died on the 30th April 1934 at his home in Leytonstone at the age of 63 years.&nbsp; The death was registered <b>on the same day</b>
          by a person who appears to be an agent of the undertaker.&nbsp; The Death Certificate (shown bottom of page) states the cause of death as
          "carcinoma of the pancreas".</p>

          <p>It seems that Arthur's death was a "moment of truth" for the rest of the family.&nbsp; Having passed the previous twelve years ostracizing
          him they found themselves confronted with a new and unwelcome situation.&nbsp; They would have to dispose of his body because no-one else
          was going to do it.</p>

          <p>It looks as though Arthur's demise was anticipated.&nbsp; Somebody decided to act with great haste.&nbsp; The undertaker was waiting
          like a vulture.</p>

          <p><u>Arthur Handley's last rites</u>:<br>

          <img src="Arthur_senior.jpg" alt="" height="482" width="220">

          In response to my letter of inquiry I received information from the City of London Cemetery, which is very close to Ilford, to the effect
          that Arthur Handley's body was cremated there on the 3rd May, 1934.&nbsp; The significance of the date is that it is <b>only three days</b>
          after his death.&nbsp; It looks as though my grandmother and her daughters organised the funeral with great haste in order to render
          impossible any participation by Arthur's surviving half-brothers and sisters who, perhaps, had supported him in the family rift.&nbsp;
          I imagine that they were extremely angry.</p>

          <p>So I presume that Arthur had just five "mourners" all of whom hated him.&nbsp; Or perhaps they boycotted the funeral despite having
          arranged it.&nbsp; But I would prefer to believe that there was another, less ugly reality.</p>

          <p>At this distance in time it is hard enough to adduce even the simplest of facts, and I have felt compelled to apply constructions
          based upon scant evidence.&nbsp; The main fact, here, is that I don't know what really happened.&nbsp; I would invite the reader to
          finish the story, if possible, in whatever way he/she might choose.</p>

          <p>As I have said, the subject of my grandfather was never discussed with me.&nbsp; But when I was aged 15, Gangan unexpectedly presented
          me with a small snuffbox containing a little photograph, displayed to the right.&nbsp; For some reason she had trimmed it with nail
          scissors, thereby depriving it of the context of the fish shop in the background.&nbsp; She wanted me to have this photo of her husband,
          and this might suggest that she did not entirely agree with the family policy of removing Arthur from history.</p>

          <p><i>If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of
          thine own were: any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
          it tolls for thee.</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From: "For Whom the Bell Tolls" by John Donne.</p>

          <p><u>Arthur Handley's last home</u>:<br>
          Arthur's Death Certificate shows that he died here in April 1934 aged 63 years.&nbsp; This was his home at 26 Cavendish Drive, Leytonstone.</p>
