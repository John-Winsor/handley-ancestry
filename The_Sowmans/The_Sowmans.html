          <p><i>Contemporary photography has played a vital role in my decision to make this presentation.&nbsp;
          It has served to insert a sense of reality into my otherwise dull words.&nbsp; I would say that
          photography passed through a "Golden Age" from late Victorian times to the early 1920's.&nbsp;
          During this period its use was confined to professionals and wealthy amateurs.&nbsp; Cameras were
          heavy and expensive, being constructed of mahogany and brass.&nbsp; Images were captured on light-
          sensitive glass plates.&nbsp; Cameras were always mounted on tripods and the photographer would expose
          the plate manually by removing the brass lens cap and counting seconds.&nbsp; Every photograph was
          specially posed and usually was well taken.&nbsp; This ended in the 1920's with the invention of roll
          film by Eastman Kodak whereupon photography became a popular pastime.&nbsp; Truly good photographs became
          submerged in an ocean of dreadful "snaps" and its employment as an artform became harder to identify.</i></p>

          <p>Pictured below is my grandmother Mary Ann Handley <i>n&eacute;e</i> Sowman aged about 21 years.&nbsp; 
          The digital enlargement of her ring finger clearly shows the impression of a ring which she had removed
          prior to the photograph.&nbsp; What a pity she wasn't wearing it.&nbsp; This was probably her engagement
          ring which, even today, is still retained within the family.</p>

          <p>The photograph below, taken in 1913, shows Aunt Alice and Uncle Will.&nbsp; Aunt Alice was sister to Mary Ann
          Sowman.&nbsp; She was born in 1867, hence was four years older than Mary.</p>

        <div class="left">
          <p>I believe that William and Alice Watson had three children, Trixie, Cissie and Clifford.&nbsp;
          William and Alice ultimately moved to Preston Park, Brighton to live in retirement.&nbsp;
          After Alice died, Gangan went to live with Uncle Will and his daughter Cissie during the 1950's.</p>
          
          <p>I can find no record of a marriage between Alice Sowman and William Watson (Uncle Will).&nbsp;
          This might be explained by Uncle Will's proclivities in which he probably viewed the institution of
          marriage as a capitulation to Church and State.&nbsp; (I have suggested elsewhere that Uncle Will was
          somewhere to the left of Lenin).</p>
          
          <p>Mary Ann and Alices's older brother was Thomas Sowman born about 1862.&nbsp; Their mother was
          Sarah Ann Sowman (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Lott) born between 1827 and 1829 in Brantham, Suffolk.&nbsp;
          Her photographs are shown below.&nbsp; Their father was Thomas Sowman born about 1827 in Polstead,
          Suffolk.&nbsp; (It appears that "Sowman" is an uncommon surname and that, today, most are living in
          Suffolk and north Essex).&nbsp; The marriage certificate for Mary Ann dated January 1894 shows the
          occupation of her father as "Boilermaker".</p>

        <div class="left">
          <p>Sarah Ann Sowman was known as "Grandma Sowman" to Gangan's children Arthur, Dora and Daisy.</p>
          <p>The 1901 Census shows that Sarah Ann, then aged 72, was resident at an Alms House in West Ham.&nbsp; 
          (I presume this was administered under the Victorian Poor Law).&nbsp; This Census also lists her daughter
          Alice Sowman who was then employed at the Alms House as a domestic servant.</p>
          <p>I understand that Sarah Ann died in 1921 at the age of about 92 years.&nbsp; I wonder whether she lived
          at the Alms House all those years between 1901 and 1921?
