vital role in my decision to make this presentation.&nbsp; It has
served to insert a sense of reality into my otherwise dull
words.&nbsp; I would say that photography passed through a "Golden
Age" from late Victorian times to the early 1920's.&nbsp; During
this period its use was confined to professionals and wealthy
amateurs.&nbsp; Cameras were heavy and expensive, being constructed
of mahogany and brass.&nbsp; Images were captured on
light-sensitive glass plates.&nbsp; Cameras were always mounted on
tripods and the photographer would expose the plate manually by
removing the brass lens cap and counting seconds.&nbsp; Every
photograph was specially posed and usually was well taken.&nbsp;
This ended in the 1920's with the invention of roll film by Eastman
Kodak whereupon photography became a popular pastime.&nbsp; Truly
good photographs became submerged in an ocean of dreadful "snaps" and
its employment as an artform became harder to identify.</i></font></td>

      <p align="left"> <font size="4">Pictured
below is my grandmother Mary Ann Handley <i>n&eacute;e</i>
Sowman aged about 21 years.&nbsp; The digital enlargement of her
ring finger clearly shows the impression of a ring which she had
removed prior to the photograph.&nbsp; What a pity she wasn't
wearing it.&nbsp; This was probably her
engagement ring which, even today, is still retained within the family.</font></p>

      <p align="left"> <font size="4"> The photograph below, taken in 1913, shows
Aunt Alice and Uncle Will.&nbsp; Aunt Alice was sister to Mary Ann Sowman.&nbsp;
She was born in 1867, hence was four years older than Mary.</font></p>

      <font size="4">I believe that William and Alice
Watson had three children, Trixie, Cissie and Clifford.&nbsp;
William and Alice ultimately moved to Preston
Park, Brighton to live in retirement.&nbsp; After Alice died,
Gangan went to
live with Uncle Will and his daughter Cissie during the 1950's.</font></p>

      <p align="left"> <font size="4">I can
find no record of a marriage between Alice Sowman and William Watson
(Uncle Will).&nbsp; This might be explained by Uncle Will's
proclivities in
which he probably viewed the institution of marriage as a capitulation
to Church
and State.&nbsp; (I have suggested elsewhere that Uncle Will was
somewhere
to the left of Lenin).</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4"> Mary
Ann and Alices's older brother was Thomas Sowman born about
1862.&nbsp; Their mother was Sarah Ann Sowman (<i>n&eacute;e</i>
Lott) born between 1827 and 1829 in Brantham, Suffolk.&nbsp; Her
photographs are shown below.&nbsp; Their father was Thomas Sowman
born about 1827 in Polstead, Suffolk.&nbsp; (It appears that
"Sowman"
is not a common surname and that, today, most are living in Suffolk and
north Essex).&nbsp; The marriage certificate for
Mary Ann dated January 1894 shows the occupation of her father as
"Boilermaker".</font></p>

      <p align="left"> <font size="4">Sarah
Ann Sowman was known as "Grandma Sowman" to
Gangan's children Arthur, Dora and Daisy.</font></p>

      <p align="left"> <font size="4">The
1901 Census shows that Sarah Ann, then aged 72, was resident at an
Alms House in West Ham.&nbsp; (I presume this was administered
under the
Victorian Poor Law).&nbsp; This Census also lists her daughter
Alice Sowman who
was then employed at the Alms House as a domestic servant.</font></p>

      <p align="left"> <font size="4">I
understand that Sarah Ann died in 1921 at the age of about 92
years.&nbsp; I wonder whether she lived at the Alms
House all those years between 1901 and 1921?</font></p>
