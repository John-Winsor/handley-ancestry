      <p align="left"><font size="4">Arthur
Curle was born 19 November 1870 in Maryland Road, Stratford then in
Essex.&nbsp; His mother is Sarah Ann Curle then aged 17 (who is my
great-grandmother).</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">The
identity of Arthur's biological father is not indicated.&nbsp; In
Victorian times an unwanted pregnancy was likely to be regarded by the
family as an economic disaster.&nbsp; That was the basis, I
suspect, of the Victorian <i>mores</i> that applied to
such circumstances although the Victorians themselves may not have
perceived it that way.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">Sarah
Ann Curle appears to be referenced in the 1861 Census where she is
listed simply as Sarah Curle aged 8.&nbsp; Her father was Thomas
Curle born about 1815 and her mother was Harriet Curle born about
1818.&nbsp; Thomas Curle's occupation is given as "House
Painter".&nbsp; They lived in West Ham on the border with
Stratford.&nbsp; These people are my great-great-grandparents.</font></p>
