          <p>Arthur Curle was born 19 November 1870 in Maryland Road, Stratford then in Essex.&nbsp;
          His mother is Sarah Ann Curle then aged 17 (who is my great-grandmother).</p>
          
          <p>The identity of Arthur's biological father is not indicated.&nbsp;
          In Victorian times an unwanted pregnancy was likely to be regarded by the family as an economic disaster.&nbsp;
          That was the basis, I suspect, of the Victorian <i>mores</i> that applied to such circumstances although the
          Victorians themselves may not have perceived it that way.</p>
          
          <p>Sarah Ann Curle is referenced in the 1861 Census where she is listed simply as Sarah Curle aged 8.&nbsp;
          Her father was Thomas Curle born about 1815 and her mother was Harriet Curle born about 1818.&nbsp;
          Thomas Curle's occupation is given as "House Painter".&nbsp; They lived in West Ham on the border with Stratford.&nbsp;
          These people are my great-great-grandparents.</p>
