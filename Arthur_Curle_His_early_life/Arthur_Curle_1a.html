          <p>Sarah Ann Curle was born in late 1853 in West Ham, then in Essex.&nbsp; Her father was Thomas Curle born 1815.&nbsp; Her mother
          was Harriet Curle born 1813.&nbsp; These people are my great-great-grandparents.&nbsp; Their lives were contemporary with that of
          Charles Dickens.</p>
          
          <p>The 1861 Census for Thomas Curle and family lists Sarah Ann then aged 8, together with her sister Jane aged 4.&nbsp; The family
          lived at 8 Church Street, West Ham.&nbsp; Thomas Curle's occupation is given as House Painter.</p>
          
          <p>The 1871 Census for <u>John</u> Curle and family lists Sarah Ann then aged 17.&nbsp; (John Curle was Sarah Ann's elder brother).&nbsp;
          This family lived in the Cripplegate district of the City of London.&nbsp; There is no indication whether Sarah Ann was living with them
          at that time or was merely visiting.&nbsp; Neither does the Census hold a record of the baby Arthur who was then just a few months old.</p>
          
          <p>In 1872 Sarah Ann married Walter John Handley, also of West Ham.&nbsp; The marriage was registered in the District of Mile End Old Town.</p>
          
          <p>There is an indication (via <i>Ancestry</i>) that Thomas Curle died in September 1876 aged 61.&nbsp; I can find no record of the
          death of Harriet Curle.</p>
          
          <p>The Census's for 1881 and 1891 list the Handley family's address as 87 Vicarage Lane, West Ham, Essex.</p>
          
          <p>According to <i>Ancestry</i> Walter John Handley died in early 1901 in Billericay, Essex aged 49 years.&nbsp; It appears that
          the entire family had moved away from West Ham during the latter half of the 1890's.&nbsp; (See the 1901 Census for Sarah Ann Handley
          and family).&nbsp; Walter John (senior), Sarah Ann and seven children had settled in Chadwell Heath, Dagenham.&nbsp; I understand that
          Walter John died in a lunatic asylum.</p>
          
          <p>The Census for 1901 shows that Sarah Ann, then widowed, was living at Beaconsfield Villas, 175 High Road, Chadwell Heath, Dagenham,
          Essex together with her seven youngest children.&nbsp; They are:&nbsp; Eva Pattie (20), Elsie Norah (18), Flora Adelaide (16), Kitty
          (Kelly?) Blanche (13), Garnet W. (8), Oscar (7) and John (4).&nbsp; Also living there was Sarah Ann's mother-in-law Martha Handley
          aged 76.</p>

          <p><u> Sarah Ann's death in 1906 aged 52 years</u>:<p>
        </div>
        <div class="left">
          <p>I discovered (via <i>Ancestry</i>) that Sarah Ann died in Chadwell Heath in 1906 at the premature age of 52 years.&nbsp;
          I have to admit that I was unable to contain my curiosity as to the cause of death.&nbsp; Might this have been the consequence of a
          tragic accident?</p>
          
          <p>So I obtained a copy of the Death Certificate.&nbsp; This shows that Sarah Ann died at an address in Whalebone Lane, Chadwell
          Heath, Dagenham on 27 June 1906.&nbsp; (That was just three weeks before the birth of my mother who was her grand-daughter).&nbsp;
          Her eldest daughter, Eva Pattie Handley, was present.&nbsp; Perhaps this was her home.</p>
          
          <p>The cause of death is given as "syncope".&nbsp; This is a medical term meaning that Sarah Ann became unconscious.&nbsp;
          The implication, here, is that she died from unknown natural causes.&nbsp; Such an explanation would hardly be adequate today but in
          1906 was evidently considered acceptable.&nbsp; The Death Certificate is shown below:</p>
