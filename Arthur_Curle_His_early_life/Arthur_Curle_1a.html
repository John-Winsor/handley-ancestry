      <font size="4"> Sarah Ann Curle was born in late
1853 in West Ham, then in Essex.&nbsp; Her father was Thomas Curle
born 1815.&nbsp; Her mother was Harriet Curle born 1813.&nbsp;
These people are my great-great-grandparents.&nbsp; Their lives
were contemporary with that of Charles Dickens.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">The 1861
Census for Thomas Curle and family lists Sarah Ann then aged 8,
together with her sister Jane aged 4.&nbsp; The family lived at 8
Church Street, West Ham.&nbsp; Thomas Curle's occupation is given
as House Painter.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">The 1871
Census for <u> John</u> Curle and family lists Sarah Ann
then aged 17.&nbsp; (John Curle was Sarah Ann's elder
brother).&nbsp; This family lived in the Cripplegate district of
the City of London.&nbsp; There is no indication whether Sarah Ann
was living with them at that time or was merely visiting.&nbsp;
Neither does the Census hold a record of the baby Arthur who was then
just a few months old.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">In 1872
Sarah Ann married Walter John Handley, also of West Ham.&nbsp; The
marriage was registered in the District of Mile End Old Town.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">There is
an indication (via <i>Ancestry.co.uk</i>) that Thomas
Curle died in September 1876 aged 61.&nbsp; I can find no record of
the death of Harriet Curle.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">The
Census's for 1881 and 1891 list the Handley family's address as 87
Vicarage Lane, West Ham, Essex.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">According
to <i>Ancestry.co.uk</i>
Walter John Handley died in early 1901 in Billericay, Essex aged 49
years.&nbsp; It appears that the entire family had moved away from
West
Ham during the latter half of the 1890's.&nbsp; (See the 1901
Census
for Sarah Ann Handley and family).&nbsp; Walter John (senior),
Sarah
Ann and seven children had settled in Chadwell Heath,
Dagenham.&nbsp; I
understand that Walter John died in a lunatic asylum.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">The
Census for 1901 shows that Sarah Ann, then widowed, was living at
Beaconsfield Villas, 175 High Road, Chadwell Heath, Dagenham, Essex
together with her seven youngest children.&nbsp; They
are:&nbsp; Eva Pattie (20), Elsie Norah (18), Flora Adelaide (16),
Kitty (Kelly?) Blanche (13), Garnet W. (8), Oscar (7) and John
(4).&nbsp; Also living there was Sarah Ann's mother-in-law Martha
Handley aged 76.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4"><br>

      <u> Sarah Ann's death in 1906 aged 52 years</u>:</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">I
discovered (via <i>Ancestry.co.uk</i>) that Sarah Ann died
in Chadwell Heath in 1906 at the premature age of 52 years.&nbsp; I
have to admit that I was unable to contain my curiosity as to the cause
of death.&nbsp; Might this have been the consequence of a tragic
accident?</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">So I
obtained a copy of the Death Certificate.&nbsp; This shows that
Sarah Ann died at an address in Whalebone Lane, Chadwell Heath,
Dagenham on 27 June 1906.&nbsp; (That was just three weeks before
the birth of my mother who was her grand-daughter).&nbsp; Her
eldest daughter, Eva Pattie Handley, was present.&nbsp; Perhaps
this was her home.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">The
cause of death is given as "syncope".&nbsp; This is a medical term
meaning that Sarah Ann became unconscious.&nbsp; The implication,
here, is that she died from unknown natural causes.&nbsp; Such an
explanation would hardly be adequate today but in 1906 was evidently
considered acceptable.&nbsp; The Death Certificate is shown below:</font></p>
