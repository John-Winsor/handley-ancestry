In conducting this little research into the Handley
family history I have been forced to accept that genealogy is a
metaphorical minefield.&nbsp; I have been confronted with various
data which are, respectively:&nbsp; certainly true, probably true,
possibly true and certainly false.&nbsp; This in addition to other
matters that are unknown and likely to remain so.&nbsp; At times I
have felt mocked by coincidence.&nbsp; I suppose all this is
typical of history in any form.&nbsp; Therefore I urge caution upon
you, the reader, and suggest that you apply whatever reservation to my
work that you regard as appropriate.</font></i></td>

My mother's father was born Arthur

      <p align="left"><br>

      <font size="4">In late 1872 Sarah Ann married Walter
John Handley who thus became Arthur`s step-father.&nbsp; The
marriage was registered in the District of Mile End Old Town.</font></p>

      <p><font size="4">In 1881 a census was taken
in which Walter and Sarah are listed together with their three
children.&nbsp; The census contains an anomaly that might suggest
that Arthur was regarded by his step-father as a "cuckoo in the nest",
a child of lesser status than his younger half-brother.&nbsp; That
was despite Arthur having been part of the family for nine years.</font></p>

      <p><font size="4">It is usual for children to
be listed in descending order of age.&nbsp; But the census shows
the first child listed as Walter John (junior) aged 7.&nbsp;
Following this is Arthur <u>Carle</u> aged 10.&nbsp;
(Arthur`s surname has been mis-spelled in transcription).&nbsp;
Against his entry is the remark:&nbsp; "Wife`s son".&nbsp; I question the
need to make the entry in this way.</font></p>

      <p><font size="4">So it appears that, in 1881,
Arthur had not been fully accepted by his step-father as a true member
of the family.&nbsp; I am glad to say, though, that the next census
taken in 1891 (when Arthur was aged 20) shows that his relationship to
his step-father is stated as "Son" (although his surname is not
explicitly shown).<img src="../Presentations_1/Arthur_Curle.jpg" align="right" border="0" width="220" height="308"></font></p>

      <p><font size="4">Did Arthur ever reveal his
humble origins to his future wife and children?&nbsp; Probably
not.&nbsp; So now in the twenty-first century we have become privy
to an ancient secret (thanks to the Internet).</font></p>

      <p><font size="4">In January 1894 Arthur
married Mary Ann Sowman, also from West Ham.&nbsp; Coincidentally,
Arthur's half-brother Walter married <i><b>another</b></i>
Mary Ann in 1900.&nbsp; So there were <b><i>two</i></b>
Mary Ann Handleys.&nbsp; I learned from my mother that this was
regarded as a big joke within the family and gave rise to the nicknames
"Big Auntie Polly" versus "Little Auntie Polly" (Gangan).</font></p>

      <p><font size="4">Arthur and Mary's first
child was Arthur Thomas born 1895 in West Ham.&nbsp; He was to die,
tragically, in 1917 in the Great War.&nbsp; (Also, Arthur's half-brothers Garnet
Handley and Oscar Handley were to die in that war).&nbsp; It is worth noting that
Arthur Thomas was <b><i>older than his uncle</i></b>
(half-uncle) John who was born to his grandmother Sarah Ann in
1897.&nbsp; Garnet, Oscar and John Handley are listed in the 1901 Census (see below) in which Sarah
Ann had become head of the Handley family.&nbsp; (Beware coincidence&nbsp; -&nbsp; <i><b>both</b></i>
Arthur Thomas's grandmothers were named Sarah Ann).</font></p>

      <p><font size="4"><a name="Return_here_2"></a>
Arthur Thomas's birth certificate (1895) states his father's occupation as "Ship's Steward".&nbsp;
He was aged 24 at that time.&nbsp; My mother kept two exotic items that her father
had acquired "during his travels":&nbsp; a Zulu war club and an ornate Chinese walking stick.&nbsp;
So I presume that Arthur reached as far as China during his time at sea.&nbsp; Arthur Handley's
various occupations are stated in other of his children's birth certificates as follows:<br>
In Hilda's birth certificate (1896):&nbsp; "Milk Carrier".<br>
In Dora's birth certificate (1901): &nbsp; "Fish Salesman".<br>
In Daisy's birth certificate (1906):&nbsp; "Fish Salesman".</font></p>

      <p><font size="4">
Following the birth of Arthur Thomas the family moved to Hornchurch,
Essex.&nbsp; There is evidence of an exodus of the entire Handley
family out of West Ham during the latter half of the 1890's.&nbsp;
Walter John (senior), Sarah Ann and the seven youngest children settled
in Chadwell Heath, Dagenham.&nbsp; Also with them was Martha
Handley who was Walter John's mother.</font></p>

<u>Click here for notes about the exodus out of West Ham.</u></a></font></p>

      <p><font size="4">In Hornchurch was born the
second child Hilda May in 1896.&nbsp; Sadly she died from
bronchitis in 1900.&nbsp; I was taken by my mother, as a child
during the 1950's, to visit her grave in the churchyard.&nbsp; It
was just a hump in the ground without headstone or marker of any
kind.&nbsp; I presume there was once a wooden cross which had
rotted away long ago.&nbsp; Next to her grave was another, also
unmarked, that of an adult relative (according to my mother).&nbsp;
Unfortunately I am unable to identify this person (who might have been
Martha Handley).</font></p>

      <p><font size="4">Following Hilda's death
Arthur, Mary and Arthur Thomas returned to West Ham where was born Dora
Mary in 1901.</font></p>

      <p><font size="4">We have moved, now, into the
twentieth century.&nbsp; Queen Victoria's life was
ending.&nbsp; The <i>Belle &Eacute;poque</i> was
beginning.&nbsp; The Great War was awaiting.&nbsp; Arthur's
early life had concluded, and he was moving on to become a successful fish shop
      proprietor and self-made entrepreneur in Ilford, Essex.</font></p>
