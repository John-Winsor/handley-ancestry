          <p>In late 1872 Sarah Ann married Walter John Handley who thus became Arthur`s step-father.&nbsp;
          The marriage was registered in the District of Mile End Old Town.</p>

          <p>In 1881 a census was taken in which Walter and Sarah are listed together with their three children.&nbsp;
          The census contains an anomaly that might suggest that Arthur was regarded by his step-father as a "cuckoo in the nest",
          a child of lesser status than his younger half-brother.&nbsp; That was despite Arthur having been part of the family
          for nine years.</p>

          <p>It is usual for children to be listed in descending order of age.&nbsp; But the census shows the first child listed as Walter John
          (junior) aged 7.&nbsp; Following this is Arthur <b>Carle</b> aged 10.&nbsp; (Arthur`s surname has been mis-spelled in transcription).&nbsp;
          Against his entry is the remark:&nbsp; "Wife`s son".&nbsp; I question the need to make the entry in this way.</p>

          <p>So it appears that, in 1881, Arthur had not been fully accepted by his step-father as a true member of the family.&nbsp;
          I am glad to say, though, that the next census taken in 1891 (when Arthur was aged 20) shows that his relationship to his
          step-father is stated as "Son" (although his surname is not explicitly shown).<p>

          <img src="./Arthur_Curle_1.jpg" alt="" height="308" width="223" >

          <p>Did Arthur ever reveal his humble origins to his future wife and children?&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp;
          So now in the twenty-first century we have become privy to an ancient secret (thanks to the Internet).</p>

          <p>In January 1894 Arthur married Mary Ann Sowman, also from West Ham.&nbsp; Coincidentally, Arthur's half-brother
          Walter married <b><i>another</i></b> Mary Ann in 1900.&nbsp; So there were <b><i>two</i></b> Mary Ann Handleys.&nbsp;
          I learned from my mother that this was regarded as a big joke within the family and gave rise to the nicknames
          "Big Auntie Polly" versus "Little Auntie Polly" (Gangan).</p>

          <p>Arthur and Mary's first child was Arthur Thomas born 1895 in West Ham.&nbsp; He was to die, tragically, in 1917 in
          the Great War.&nbsp; (Also, Arthur's half-brothers Garnet Handley and Oscar Handley were to die in that war).&nbsp;
          It is worth noting that Arthur Thomas was <b><i>older than his uncle</i></b> (half-uncle) John who was born to his
          grandmother Sarah Ann in 1897.&nbsp; Garnet, Oscar and John Handley are listed in the 1901 Census (see below) in which
          Sarah Ann had become head of the Handley family.&nbsp; (Beware coincidence, <b><i>both</i></b> Arthur Thomas's grandmothers
          were named Sarah Ann).</p>

          <a name="Return_here_2"></a>
          <p>Arthur Thomas's birth certificate (1895) states his father's occupation as "Ship's Steward".&nbsp;
          He was aged 24 at that time.&nbsp; My mother kept two exotic items that her father had acquired "during his travels":&nbsp;
          a Zulu war club and an ornate Chinese walking stick.&nbsp; So I presume that Arthur reached as far as China during his time
          at sea.&nbsp; Arthur Handley's various occupations are stated in other of his children's birth certificates as follows:<br>
          In Hilda's birth certificate (1896):&nbsp; "Milk Carrier".<br>
          In Dora's birth certificate (1901): &nbsp; "Fish Salesman".<br>
          In Daisy's birth certificate (1906):&nbsp; "Fish Salesman".</p>

          <p>Following the birth of Arthur Thomas the family moved to Hornchurch, Essex.&nbsp; There is evidence of an exodus of the
          entire Handley family out of West Ham during the latter half of the 1890's.&nbsp; Walter John (senior), Sarah Ann and the
          seven youngest children settled in Chadwell Heath, Dagenham.&nbsp; Also with them was Martha Handley who was Walter John's
          mother.</p>

          <p><a href="Arthur_Curle_1b.html"><span style="color:#0000ff;">
          Click <i>HERE</i> for notes about the exodus out of West Ham.</span></a></p>

          <p>In Hornchurch was born the second child Hilda May in 1896.&nbsp; Sadly she died from bronchitis in 1900.&nbsp; I was taken
          by my mother, as a child during the 1950's, to visit her grave in the churchyard.&nbsp; It was just a hump in the ground
          without headstone or marker of any kind.&nbsp; I presume there was once a wooden cross that had rotted away long ago.&nbsp;
          Next to her grave was another, also unmarked, that of an adult relative (according to my mother).&nbsp;
          Unfortunately I am unable to identify this person (who might have been Martha Handley).</p>

          <p>Following Hilda's death Arthur, Mary and Arthur Thomas returned to West Ham where was born Dora Mary in 1901.</p>

          <p>We have moved, now, into the twentieth century.&nbsp; Queen Victoria's life was ending.&nbsp; We have moved, now, into
          the twentieth century.&nbsp; Queen Victoria's life was ending.&nbsp; The <i>Belle &Eacute;poque</i> was beginning.&nbsp;
          The Great War was awaiting.&nbsp; Arthur's early life had concluded, and he was moving on to become a successful fish shop
          proprietor and self-made entrepreneur in Ilford, Essex.</p>
