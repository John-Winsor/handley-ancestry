      <font size="4">I am very curious about this exodus
which occurred during the latter half of the 1890's.&nbsp; Here was
a large family of Londoners who appear, suddenly, to have decided to
quit West Ham.&nbsp; The majority went to live in Chadwell Heath,
then just a country village.&nbsp; Arthur Handley had married and
had already left the family home to live locally.&nbsp; Arthur,
Mary and Arthur Thomas moved to Hornchurch which was then little more than a
      village.&nbsp; Walter John (junior) and his wife moved to Ilford,
only four miles from West Ham, and opened a fish shop.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">I have
tended to attribute the decision to move to the poor air quality in
West Ham, caused by the gigantic gasworks in nearby Beckton.&nbsp; It seems
      likely that the decision to move was made following the death of John Handley in
      1898.<img border="0" src="Martha_Handley.jpg" align="right" width="220" height="300"></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">Martha Handley, widow of John Handley and
      mother of Walter John (senior), also moved to Chadwell Heath and lived in
      the home of Sarah Ann Handley.&nbsp; The census of 1901 shows that there
      were a total of nine people in that household.&nbsp; Martha was then aged
      76.&nbsp; A photograph of Martha Handley, probably taken in Stratford, has been discovered and is
      displayed herewith.&nbsp; She is shown holding a lorgnette on a little
      chain.&nbsp; She was born in 1824 and died in 1908 aged 84 years.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">Recently
I learned that Walter John (senior) died in a lunatic asylum in
Billericay, Essex (a few miles from Chadwell Heath) in 1901 aged 49
years.&nbsp; It seems likely that his mental health had been
deteriorating for several years prior to his death.&nbsp; He may
long have ceased to function effectively as head of the family and
principal breadwinner.&nbsp; This may have been an important factor
in the decision to move.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font size="4">To the
Handley family, I believe, the solution to their various problems
seemed to lie in the railway line that extended eastward out of London.</font></p>
