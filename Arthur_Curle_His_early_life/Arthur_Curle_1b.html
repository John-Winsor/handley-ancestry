          <p>I am very curious about this exodus which occurred during the latter half of the 1890's.&nbsp;
          Here was a large family of Londoners who appear, suddenly, to have decided to quit West Ham.&nbsp;
          The majority went to live in Chadwell Heath, then just a country village.&nbsp; Arthur Handley had married and had already
          left the family home to live locally.&nbsp; Arthur, Mary and Arthur Thomas moved to Hornchurch which was then little more than
          a village.&nbsp; Walter John (junior) and his wife moved to Ilford, only four miles from West Ham, and opened a fish shop.</p>

          <p>I have tended to attribute the decision to move to the poor air quality in West Ham, caused by the gigantic gasworks in
          nearby Beckton.&nbsp; It seems likely that the decision to move was made following the death of John Handley in 1898.</p>

          <p>Martha Handley, widow of John Handley and mother of Walter John (senior), also moved to Chadwell Heath and lived in the home
          of Sarah Ann Handley.&nbsp; The census of 1901 shows that there were a total of nine people in that household.&nbsp; Martha was
          then aged 76.&nbsp; A photograph of Martha Handley, probably taken in Stratford, has been discovered and is displayed herewith.&nbsp;
          She is shown holding a lorgnette on a little chain.&nbsp; She was born in 1824 and died in 1908 aged 84 years.</p>

          <p >Recently I learned that Walter John (senior) died in a lunatic asylum in Billericay, Essex (a few miles from Chadwell Heath)
          in 1901 aged 49 years.&nbsp; It seems likely that his mental health had been deteriorating for several years prior to his death.&nbsp;
          He may long have ceased to function effectively as head of the family and principal breadwinner.&nbsp; This may have been an important
          factor in the decision to move.</p>

          <p>To the Handley family, I believe, the solution to their various problems seemed to lie in the railway line that extended eastward
          out of London.</p>
