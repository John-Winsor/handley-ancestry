          <p>Christmas in 2011 has a special significance because it is the one-hundredth anniversary of CHUMS ANNUAL 1911.&nbsp;
          This book is a compendium of all the weekly issues of Chums magazine published in 1911 and was a Christmas present to
          Arthur Thomas Handley from his parents.&nbsp; Eventually it passed to my mother, from her to myself, and from me to other
          descendants of the Handley family.</p>
          
          <img src="./Arthur_Thomas_15.jpg" alt="" height="286" width="220">
          
          <p>My gift of Chums in 2002 marked the start of the "Handley Family" project (cf. Internet:&nbsp; <i>About this Website</i>)
          which comprised the distribution of various heirlooms, photographs, anecdotes and reminiscences.&nbsp; I think the hundredth
          anniversary of the book is a propitious time to close this project so that, in a sense, it is ending where it started.&nbsp;
          For the last nine years I have travelled a circular path in which I have distributed all the memorabilia in my possession
          (whether the recipients wanted them or not).</p>
          
          <p>I think that family connections are uniquely powerful, even connections with those ancestors and family members for whom
          no memory exists today.&nbsp; Heirlooms are tangible symbols of those connections and can manifest a power of their own.&nbsp;
          I have sought to evoke that power only in ways that are positive.</p>
          
          <p>I would say that Chums is the "jewel in the crown" of the Handley legacy, the best of my collection of their heirlooms.&nbsp;
          As a young person I would read Chums avidly and the stories are still brilliant in my memory.&nbsp; It became my most cherished
          possession.&nbsp; The stories, pictures and even the advertisements are an open window on the social climate of 1911.&nbsp;
          From the perspective of the twenty-first century the book is a treasure of great intellectual value.&nbsp; These are some of the
          reasons why the book has survived a hundred years.</p>
          
          <p>When my mother first introduced me to Chums it was in pristine condition.&nbsp; It seemed that Arthur Thomas had hardly opened
          it.&nbsp; Perhaps he felt that the book was intended for boys slightly younger than his own age of 16 years in 1911.&nbsp;
          Initially my mother seemed to have a policy of restricting my access to the book, no doubt to preserve its condition.&nbsp;
          I must admit that the book did accumulate a small amount of damage, but the greatest threat would be the deterioration of the
          paper which is only of newsprint quality.</p>
          
          <p>Today, Chums has some of the characteristics of a "time capsule".&nbsp; I hope it will remain within the family for another
          hundred years at least and that many will benefit from reading it.&nbsp; Happy hundredth birthday, Chums.</p>
