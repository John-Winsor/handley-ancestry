      <p align="left"> <font color="#000000" size="4">Christmas in 2011 has a special significance
because it is the one-hundredth anniversary of CHUMS ANNUAL
1911.&nbsp; This book is a compendium of all the weekly issues of
Chums magazine published in 1911 and was a Christmas present to Arthur
Thomas Handley from his parents.&nbsp; Eventually it passed to my
mother, from her to myself, and from me to other descendants of the
Handley family.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4"><img src="Arthur_Thomas_15.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="286" width="220">My
gift of Chums in 2002 marked the start of the "Handley Family" project
(cf. Internet:&nbsp; <i>About this Website</i>) which
comprised the distribution of various heirlooms, photographs, anecdotes
and reminiscences.&nbsp; I think the hundredth anniversary of the
book is a propitious time to close this project so that, in a sense, it
is ending where it started.&nbsp; For the last nine years I have
travelled a circular path in which I have distributed all the
memorabilia in my possession (whether the recipients wanted them or
not).</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">I think that family connections are uniquely
powerful, even connections with those ancestors and family members for
whom no memory exists today.&nbsp; Heirlooms are tangible symbols
of those connections and can manifest a power of their own.&nbsp; I
have sought to evoke that power only in ways that are positive.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">I would say that Chums is the "jewel in the crown"
of the Handley legacy, the best of my collection of their
heirlooms.&nbsp; As a young person I would read Chums avidly and
the stories are still brilliant in my memory.&nbsp; It became my
most cherished possession.&nbsp; The stories, pictures and even the
advertisements are an open window on the social climate of
1911.&nbsp; From the perspective of the twenty-first century the
book is a treasure of great intellectual value.&nbsp; <span lang="EN-GB">These are some of the reasons why the book has
survived a hundred years.</span></font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">When my mother first introduced me to Chums it was
in pristine condition.&nbsp; It seemed that Arthur Thomas had
hardly opened it.&nbsp; Perhaps he felt that the book was intended
for boys slightly younger than his own age of 16 years in
1911.&nbsp; Initially my mother seemed to have a policy of
restricting my access to the book, no doubt to preserve its
condition.&nbsp; I must admit that the book did accumulate a small
amount of damage, but the greatest threat would be the deterioration of
the paper which is only of newsprint quality.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">Today, Chums has some of the characteristics of a
"time capsule".&nbsp; I hope it will remain within the family for
another hundred years at least and that many will benefit from reading
it.&nbsp; Happy hundredth birthday, Chums.</font></p>
