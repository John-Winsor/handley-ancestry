          <p>Arthur Handley was born Arthur Curle and was <i>NOT</i> a descendant of the Handley family.&nbsp;
          His Birth Certificate does not identify his father and leaves only a blank space.&nbsp; So Arthur's birth was
          registered in his mother's surname.&nbsp; Subsequently his mother married Walter John Handley who, in the course
          of time, gave his surname to his step-son.</p>
